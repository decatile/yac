# Yac - Simple Expression Interpreter

Yac is a lightweight expression-based language implemented in Rust, designed for simple arithmetic operations, variable assignments, and function definitions. It offers a clean REPL interface for interactive calculations.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Support for unary operations (unary +, unary -, and logical NOT !)
- Support for negative numbers and floating-point calculations
- Variable assignment and scoping
- User-defined functions with arguments
- Built-in functions (like `abs()`)
- Error handling for common issues (division by zero, undefined variables, etc.)
- Comparison operators: <, <=, ==, !=, >=, >
- Ternary conditional operations (?:)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (2024 edition or newer)

### Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/decatile/yac.git
cd yac
```

### Run the Interpreter

Start the REPL interpreter:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Language Guide

### Basic Expressions

Expressions can include numbers, variables, function calls, and arithmetic operations:

```
> 1 + 2
3
> 10 - 5
5
> 3 * 4
12
> 10 / 2
5
```

Both unary plus, minus, and logical NOT are supported:

```
> -5
-5
> +5
5
> -+5  # Unary operations can be chained
-5
> +-5
-5
> !0   # Logical NOT: returns 1 for zero, 0 for non-zero
1
> !5
0
> !!0  # Double negation
0
> !(1 - 1)
1
```

Yac follows standard operator precedence rules:

```
> 1 + 2 * 3
7
> (1 + 2) * 3
9
```

### Variables

Assign values to variables with the `=` operator:

```
> x = 10
10
> y = 20
20
> x + y
30
```

Variables can be reassigned:

```
> x = x + 5
15
> x
15
```

You can also prompt for variable values interactively by using the `?` operator:

```
> x = ?
Enter value for variable 'x': 42
42
> x + 10
52
```

This feature is useful for scenarios where variable values need to be provided dynamically during execution.

### Functions

Define functions using the format `name(param1, param2, ...) = expression`:

```
> double(x) = x * 2
Ok!
> double(5)
10
```

Functions operate within their own scope and can only access their parameters, not global variables:

```
> base = 10
10
> scale(x) = x * 2 
Ok!
> scale(5)
10
> scale(base)
20
```

Multiple arguments are supported:

```
> sum(a, b) = a + b
Ok!
> sum(5, 10)
15
> product(a, b) = a * b
Ok!
> sum(product(2, 3), product(4, 5))
26
```

### Complex Examples

Combine variables, functions, and expressions:

```
> radius = 5
5
> pi = 3.14159
3.14159
> circle_area(r) = pi * r * r
Ok!
> circle_area(radius)
78.53975
```

Nested function calls and operations:

```
> square(x) = x * x
Ok!
> cube(x) = x * square(x)
Ok!
> cube(3)
27
```

Using built-in functions:

```
> abs(-10)
10
> x = -5
-5
> abs(x) + 10
15
```

### Error Handling

Yac provides detailed error messages that help identify and fix issues in your code:

```
> 10 / 0
Division by expression that evaluates to zero: '0'

> undefined_var
Undefined variable: 'undefined_var'

> undefined_func(5)
Undefined function: 'undefined_func'

> double(1, 2)  # after defining double(x) = x * 2
Invalid number of arguments for function 'double': expected 1, got 2
```

The error messages include:
- The type of error that occurred
- The specific problematic expression or identifier
- Additional context information when applicable (expected vs. actual argument count)

For parsing errors, the interpreter will also point to the location of the syntax error

### Comparison Operators

Yac supports standard comparison operators:

```
> 5 < 10
1
> 5 > 10
0
> 5 <= 5
1
> 5 >= 10
0
> 5 == 5
1
> 5 != 10
1
```

Comparison operators return 1 for true and 0 for false.

### Ternary Operator

Yac supports the ternary conditional operator with the syntax `condition ? true_expression : false_expression`:

```
> (5 > 3) ? 1 : 0
1
> (5 < 3) ? 1 : 0
0
```

**Important:** When using complex expressions in conditions, they must be enclosed in parentheses:

```
> (5 > 3) ? 1 : 0  # Correct with parentheses
```

The ternary operator first evaluates the condition. If the condition evaluates to non-zero (true), the first expression after the question mark is evaluated and returned. Otherwise, the expression after the colon is evaluated and returned:

```
> x = 10
10
> y = 5
5
> (x > y) ? x : y
10
> (x < y) ? x : y
5
```

Ternary operators can be used in assignments and function definitions:

```
> max(a, b) = (a > b) ? a : b
Ok!
> max(10, 5)
10
> max(3, 7)
7
```

You can also nest ternary operators for more complex conditional logic, but remember to use parentheses:

```
> x = 5
5
> y = 10
10
> z = 7
7
> (x > y) ? x : (y > z) ? y : z
10
```

In this example, if x > y, return x; otherwise, if y > z, return y; otherwise, return z.

### Special REPL Commands

The interpreter responds to these special commands:

```
> help
```
Displays a list of available commands.

```
> help functions
```
Lists all defined functions (both built-in and user-defined) with their parameter counts.

```
> clear
```
Clears the terminal screen.

```
> exit
```
Exits the interpreter.
